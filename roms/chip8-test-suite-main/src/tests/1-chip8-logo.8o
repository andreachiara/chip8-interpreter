# CHIP-8 logo ROM by Timendus, published here before:
# https://github.com/Timendus/chip-8/blob/master/octo/CHIP-8%20logo.8o

# 132 bytes, 20 cycles to show "CHIP-8" on the screen
#
# This ROM is simpler than the IBM logo in two ways:
#  a) It does not use the addition instruction
#  b) It only renders aligned sprites (all coordinates are multiples of 8)
#
# Uses only these five instructions:
#  * Clear the screen
#  * Load normal register with immediate value
#  * Load i register with immediate value
#  * Draw sprite to screen (only aligned)
#  * Jump (at the end, so kinda optional)

:macro show X address {
  v0 := X
  i := address
  sprite v0 v1 15
}

: main
  clear

  v1 := 1
  show  8 splash-0-0
  show 16 splash-1-0
  show 24 splash-2-0
  show 32 splash-3-0
  show 40 splash-4-0
  show 48 splash-5-0

  v1 := 16
  show  8 splash-0-1
  show 16 splash-1-1
  show 24 splash-2-1
  show 32 splash-3-1
